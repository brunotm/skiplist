Concurrent skiplist on golang

Basically you don't need concurrent data structures in golang, moreover do not use one before it is really necessary. Even more if you think it is a good idea to share any data between go routines directly - think twice and try to redesign application...

However if you decided to use concurrent list at the end then welcome
